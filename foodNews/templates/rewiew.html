<p>Indulging in a Frappuccino is a simple pleasure that Starbucks is constantly fueling. There are the everyday flavors like mocha, caramel, and java chip, but there are so many offered for a limited time or only in other countries. While all of these may not be available right this second, theyâ€™ve popped up in these countries before, so hopefully your favorites make their ways around again!</p>
